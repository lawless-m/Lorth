Using my TIL and someone elses' mod to bootstrap a Forth for the game Factorio

To work in Factorio it needs the LuaCombinator Mod

Doesn't work yet, this is me getting started

Forth
=====

Not an ANSI Forth but a Threaded Interpretive Language built from the text of Loeliger's book - Threaded Interpretive Languages
